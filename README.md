### Hi hi! ðŸ˜„

### I'm Elisha, an up-and-coming full-stack software developer!
I'm based in Portland, OR, where I graduated from The Tech Academy.

Although I'm full-stack trained, I do enjoy front-end development slightly\
more, so work and collaboration in web development is the dream! ðŸ˜Ž

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn, which is linked to the left, or\
here on GitHub! I would love to work with you on your next project!

Fun fact: I've always wanted to be a coder, even before I knew what that\
was, because of the super smart, funny characters that could type really\
fast and had all the answers! ðŸ˜‚
