### Hi hi! ðŸ˜„ I'm Elisha, an up-and-coming full-stack software developer!
I'm based in Portland, OR, where I graduated from The Tech Academy.

ðŸ˜Ž Although I'm full-stack trained, I do enjoy front-end development slightly more, so work and collaboration in web development is the dream!

ðŸŒ± Still learning and practicing everyday! I've very excited for this career switch!!

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn, which is linked to the left, or here on GitHub! I would love to work with you on your next project!

âš¡ Fun fact: I've always wanted to be a coder, even before I knew what that was, because of the super smart, funny characters that could type really fast and had all the answers! ðŸ˜‚
